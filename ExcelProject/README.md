#HR Employee Attrition Analysis & Retention Dashboard

##Executive Summary

###This project identifies and quantifies the primary factors contributing to employee turnover using the HR attrition dataset. By transforming raw data into targeted metrics, we established a benchmark Overall Attrition Rate of 16.12%. The analysis reveals that attrition risk is critically high among specific segments, notably entry-level sales roles, employees in the lowest salary tiers, and new hires in their first year of service.
###The final output is an interactive Excel dashboard designed to enable HR leadership to perform drill-down analysis and prioritize retention efforts.
